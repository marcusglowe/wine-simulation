# Wine Simualation
===============

A deliverable for my project for MIT's 6.163: Strobe Lab.

This demo shows the simulation of wine particles as they move and uses WebGL through the THREE.js wrapper. 

To see the simulation, navigate in your browser to the particles.html file. You may use the arrow keys to rotate around. The simulation loops after the explosion is completed.
